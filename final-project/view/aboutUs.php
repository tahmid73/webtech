    <h3>Upstreams</h3>
    <p>
        We maintain connections to multiple upstream providers with multiple fiber
     optic cable capable of 10Gbps bandwidth to provide redundancy 
    and reliability for your connection to the Internet.
    </p>
    <h3>Network Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>
    We feature a redundant server setup to provide uninterrupted Internet Service. 
    Every POP of our network is connected by multiple links making it close to impossible 
    to lose physical connectivity due to fiber cut and also each POP is equipped with enough
     power backup to run for four days.
